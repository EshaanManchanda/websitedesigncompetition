# Root Environment Variables (Monorepo)
#
# NOTE: With the new project structure, environment variables are organized as follows:
#
# - Frontend variables: See frontend/.env.example
# - Backend variables: See backend/.env.example
#
# This root .env file is optional and can be used for shared workspace-level
# configuration if needed in the future.
#
# For now, configure environment variables in their respective directories:
# - Frontend: Copy frontend/.env.example to frontend/.env
# - Backend: Copy backend/.env.example to backend/.env
